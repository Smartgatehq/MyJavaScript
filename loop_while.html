    <h1>JavaScript While Loop</h1>
    <p>Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.</p>

    <h2>The While Loop</h2>
    <p>The <b>while</b> loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.</p>

    <dl>Syntax:
        <li>
            while (condition) { <br>
            // code block to be executed <br>
          }
        </li>
    </dl>

    <h2><i>Example 1</i></h2>
    <p>
        In this following example, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as <br>
        a variable (i) is less than 10:
    </p>
    <p id="example1"></p>
        
    <script>
        let text = "";
        let i = 0;
        while (i < 10) {
        text += "<br>The number is " + i;
        i++;
        }
        document.getElementById("example1").innerHTML = text;
    </script>

    <p><i><b>NOTE:</b> If you forget to increase the variable used in the condition, the loop will never end. 
        This will crash your browser.</i></p> <br>

    
    <h2>The Do While Loop</h2>
    <p>The <b>do while loop</b> is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, <br>
        before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.</p>
